bb (BioBrew) is a tiny and personal package manager that allows you 
to quickly setup your toolbox in a new (and perhaps hostile) environment.

bb also tries to focus on bio informatics tools (bfast, samtools, bwa, 
picard tools, ...)  as well as crucial UNIX tools (vim, cdargs, etc ...).

           : use 'list installed' for only installed recipes.

  activate : make this recipe live.
  fake     : pretend to install this recipe.
  unlock   : remove lock and installed files
  clean    : USE WITH CAUTION!
             remove all traces of a recipe/program.
